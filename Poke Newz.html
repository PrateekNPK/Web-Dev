            <h3 class="card-title text-center">Dragonite Is Now Available in Pokémon UNITE</h3>
            <h5 class="card-title text-center">Add a Melee All-Rounder to your UNITE team with a draconic powerhouse leveraging the power of fire, water, electricity, and dance in its attacks.</h5>
             <p class="card-text text-center">Rampage through the competition in Pokémon UNITE with Dragonite, now available to join your team. This Pokémon is a Melee All-Rounder, and it's ready to unleash twisters, comets, fire, water, and electricity on the competition. Dragonite begins each match as Dratini, but it will evolve into Dragonair at Lv. 5 and Dragonite at Lv. 8.

                The basic attacks for all three Pokémon—Dratini, Dragonair, and Dragonite—are boosted with every third attack, and they reduce the cooldown period for the Pokémon's other moves. In addition, the basic attacks have certain effects that differ as the Pokémon evolves in battle.
                
                Dratini's boosted basic attack blasts water in front of Dratini. This water attack deals damage to opposing Pokémon it hits and has the additional benefit of restoring Dratini's HP when it hits.
                
                Dragonair's boosted attack alternates between a water attack and an electric attack with each use. If the water attack hits, it triggers the same additional effect as Dratini's boosted basic attack. If the electric attack hits, it leaves the opposing Pokémon unable to act for a short time.
                
                Finally, Dragonite's boosted attack adds a little heat to the rotation—it alternates between a water attack, an electric attack, and a fire attack (in that order) with every use. If the water or electric attacks hit, they trigger the same additional effects as Dragonair's boosted basic attacks. If the fire attack hits, it deals additional damage to the opposing Pokémon.
                
                Dratini and Dragonair's Marvel Scale Ability increases their Defense when they are afflicted with a status condition. Then, when Dragonair evolves into Dragonite, the Ability switches to Multiscale, which reduces the damage Dragonite receives for a short time. The Ability goes on cooldown after being triggered.</p>
