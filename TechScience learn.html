            <h2>Father of Science,Physics</h2>
            <p style="color: white; font-size: 20px;">Galileo di Vincenzo Bonaiuti de' Galilei , commonly referred to as Galileo, was an astronomer, physicist and engineer, sometimes described as a polymath, from Pisa, in modern-day Italy. Galileo has been called the "father of observational astronomy", the "father of modern physics", the "father of the scientific method", and the "father of modern science".</p><br><br>
            <h2>Aristotle</h2>
            <img height="300px" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/Aristotle_Bust_White_Background_Transparent.png">
            <h2>Father of Biology</h2>
            <p style="color: white; font-size: 20px;">Aristotle was a Greek philosopher and polymath during the Classical period in Ancient Greece. Taught by Plato, he was the founder of the Lyceum, the Peripatetic school of philosophy, and the Aristotelian tradition. His writings cover many subjects including physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, aesthetics, poetry, theatre, music, rhetoric, psychology, linguistics, economics, politics, meteorology, geology and government.</p><br><br>
            <h2>Antonie Lavoiser</h2>

            <h2>Father of Chemistry</h2>
            <p style="color: white; font-size: 20px;">Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier also Antoine Lavoisier after the French Revolution, was a French nobleman and chemist who was central to the 18th-century chemical revolution and who had a large influence on both the history of chemistry and the history of biology.[5] It is generally accepted that Lavoisier's great accomplishments in chemistry stem largely from his changing the science from a qualitative to a quantitative one. Lavoisier is most noted for his discovery of the role oxygen plays in combustion.</p><br><br>
            <h2>C. V. Raman</h2>
            <img height="300px" src="https://www.biography.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/image_thumb13.png">
            <h2>Indian Physicist</h2>
            <p style="color: white; font-size: 20px;">Sir Chandrasekhara Venkata Ramanwas an Indian physicist known for his work in the field of light scattering. Using a spectrograph that he developed, he and his student K. S. Krishnan discovered that when light traverses a transparent material, the deflected light changes its wavelength and frequency. This phenomenon, a hitherto unknown type of scattering of light, which they called "modified scattering" was subsequently termed the Raman effect.</p><br><br>

            <h2>Zacharias Janssen</h2>
            <p style="color: white; font-size: 20px;">A microscope is a laboratory instrument used to examine objects that are too small to be seen by the naked eye. Microscopy is the science of investigating small objects and structures using a microscope. Microscopic means being invisible to the eye unless aided by a microscope.</p><br><br>
            <h2>Gravity</h2>
            <img height="200px" src="https://i.gifer.com/7PXW.gif">
            <h2>Issac Newton</h2>
            <p style="color: white; font-size: 20px;">Gravity (from Latin gravitas 'weight'), or gravitation, is a natural phenomenon by which all things with mass or energy—including planets, stars, galaxies, and even light—are attracted to (or gravitate toward) one another. ... Gravity has an infinite range, although its effects become weaker as objects get farther away.</p><br><br>
            <h2>Radium</h2>

            <h2>Marie Curie, Pierre Curie</h2>
            <p style="color: white; font-size: 20px;">Radium (chemical symbol Ra) is a naturally occurring radioactive metal. Radium is a radionuclide formed by the decay of uranium and thorium in the environment. The most common isotopes. ... All isotopes of radium are radioactive. Radium decays to produce radon gas.</p><br><br>

            <p style="color: white; font-size: 20px;">A cell is a mass of cytoplasm that is bound externally by a cell membrane. Usually microscopic in size, cells are the smallest structural units of living matter and compose all living things. Most cells have one or more nuclei and other organelles that carry out a variety of tasks.</p><br><br>

            <h2>Alexander Graham Bell</h2>
            <p style="color: white; font-size: 20px;">A telephone is a telecommunications device that permits two or more users to conduct a conversation when they are too far apart to be heard directly. A telephone converts sound, typically and most efficiently the human voice, into electronic signals that are transmitted via cables and other communication channels to another telephone which reproduces the sound to the receiving user. The term is derived from Greek: τῆλε (tēle, far) and φωνή (phōnē, voice), together meaning distant voice. A common short form of the term is phone, which came into use almost immediately after the first patent was issued.</p><br><br>

            <h2>Nikola Tesla</h2>
            <p style="color: white; font-size: 20px;">A Tesla coil is an electrical resonant transformer circuit designed by inventor Nikola Tesla in 1891. It is used to produce high-voltage, low-current, high frequency alternating-current electricity. Tesla experimented with a number of different configurations consisting of two, or sometimes three, coupled resonant electric circuits.</p><br><br>
